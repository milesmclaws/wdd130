            <h2>Hi I'm Miles</h2>
            <p>I am from Farmington Utah and come from family of six.
                My life has been full of awesome experience. As a boy 
                I really like sports and I especially enjoyed Football.
                Football thought me a lot about life especially How to 
                work hard. I learn many things like how to work as a team
                and the time and effort you need to put into something to
                be the best. In the off season I spent time doing some coustodial
                and learned about cleaning and landscaping.

               <p> After High school
                I choose to Leave for 2 years and serve a mission for the church
                of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Sate of west virgina.
                This experience taught me a lot of new things. I learn how to 
                be a good public speaker and how to manage my time well. I also had
                the previllage of teaching new missionaries and helping them become 
                good teachers and examples to others around them. I have no since returned
                from my mission. I now am attending the Unisverity of BYU idaho as a 
                student.
